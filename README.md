### My Assignment due week 12 for processig
**How I worked on my assignment:**
I coded on my assignemnt which is due to be submitted and demoed on the 12/12/2017. 
>This is a weapon system designed on traveling through space. 
I did not start until the end of november and had a few assignments as well as part time work
>which made me release one mistake on this assignment which was not starting early enough.
However, the assignment itself contains majority of the features which i had originally envisoned for this assignment

>I spent days researching on sites and problem solving in order to get most of the features on my assignment working.
Allowing many of the code to work together and make sure eventhing was running smoothly

**Features I am proud of:**

>The fact you can interact with the system itself, such as shoot bullets and speed forward is the features I would 
>be most proud of. There is plenty of user interaction which i like myself.
>The fact I think this is a prototype of what could become a reality is the prospect which I really like

**some controls not stated in the programme**
>You can press the **UP** key to move forward at a faster rate, **down** to slow down, **Left** to move left
>and **right** to move right. You can also press the **Space** bar to shoot regular bullets  and **1** to shoot bombs, based upon your >mouse location
